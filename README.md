# Sudoku solver using Dancing Links (DLX)
Sudoku can be reduced to a exact cover problem which is known to be
NP-complete. The classification of NP-complete is only for a generalized nxn
Sudoku and not a 9x9 Sudoku because it is a finite instance.

The exact cover problem is a decision problem where the objective is to find a
exact cover. Given a set S and another set where each element is a subset to
S, is is possible to select a set of subsets such that every element in S
exist in exactly one of the selected sets? This selection of sets is said to
be a cover of the set S.

Algorithm X (ALX) created by Donald Knuth can be used to find all solutions to
a exact cover problem. Dancing Links (DLX) is the technique suggested by
Knuth for implementing Algorithm X efficiently.

This solver implements the DLX algorithm as described by Knuth but the
reduction of a Sudoku to a exact cover problem is not truly a full reduction
because its reduced directly to the links used in DLX. The full reduction would
have been to first reduce the Sudoku to a binary matrix and then create the
links used in DLX. The only reason for this is gain in performance but it is
less flexible since this reduction can only be used with DLX.

## Installation
The solver depends on [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and can be installed as
described below with a virtual environment and pip or by installing [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/).
The second dependency [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is only
required if you wish to run the test code.

Click [here](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html) for more
information on using pip and installing a virtual environment.

    $ virtualenv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    (venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run all tests

    (venv)$ nosetests

### Note on test data
There are tons of test data available in `tests/data/collections`, most
notably `all_17` which contains 49151 Sudoku challenges with 17 clues and
allegedly this is all possible challenges with 17 clues. Note that 17 clues
does not mean longest solving time. A second huge file  `random` contains
21460 different Sudoku challenges of varying (human) difficulty rating.
Specify `-v` to validate the solution and to search for more than one solution.

## Run
Show the argument options

    (venv)$ python sudoku.py -h
    Usage: sudoku.py [options]

    Options:
      -h, --help      show this help message and exit
      -v, --validate  validate solution (longer search time)
      -p, --pretty    pretty print solution

You can either provide the solver from stdin or by file. The input must be on
the following form

    .......12........3..23..4....18....5.6..7.8.......9.....85.....9...4.5..47...6...

each line represents a new Sudoku challenge. For instance

    $ python sudoku.py tests/data/platinum_blonde
    839465712146782953752391486391824675564173829287659341628537194913248567475916238

    $ python sudoku.py < tests/data/platinum_blonde
    839465712146782953752391486391824675564173829287659341628537194913248567475916238

    $ cat tests/data/platinum_blonde | python sudoku.py
    839465712146782953752391486391824675564173829287659341628537194913248567475916238

or on a more human readable form

    $ python sudoku.py --pretty tests/data/platinum_blonde
    +-------+-------+-------+
    | 8 3 9 | 4 6 5 | 7 1 2 |
    | 1 4 6 | 7 8 2 | 9 5 3 |
    | 7 5 2 | 3 9 1 | 4 8 6 |
    +-------+-------+-------+
    | 3 9 1 | 8 2 4 | 6 7 5 |
    | 5 6 4 | 1 7 3 | 8 2 9 |
    | 2 8 7 | 6 5 9 | 3 4 1 |
    +-------+-------+-------+
    | 6 2 8 | 5 3 7 | 1 9 4 |
    | 9 1 3 | 2 4 8 | 5 6 7 |
    | 4 7 5 | 9 1 6 | 2 3 8 |
    +-------+-------+-------+
